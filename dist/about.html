            <h4> <span style = "color : white"> 90% of sports science ignores female biology. We are here to change that. </span> </h4>

                <p>Rhythm is an app to help women understand how their menstrual cycle impacts their fitness and overall wellness.</p> 
                <p>The idea came about when we learned that 70%+ of physical science research is based on male subjects and that women perform better than men over ultramarathon distances.</p> 
                <p>It got us thinking - how many other sports can women outperform men in if we actually took the time to understand how menstrual cycles impact performance? Rhythm is trying to answer this question.</p> 
                <p>We want to go beyond other apps and provide automated training adjustments based on your current physiology, and specific, measurable training targets adapted to your cycle phase.</p>
